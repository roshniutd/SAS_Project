
For R

I have changed the following file extensions to run in the r code:

laundet_groc_1114_1165 - .txt
prod_laundet - .xls
Delivery_Stores - .csv
IRI week translation - xls

Be sure to change them before it is run in R markdown.



For Tableau
The data needed for Tableau is created by the R code and mentioned as a comment in the R markdown file provided.
write.csv(data, file = "tableau.csv") 

Note to generate the file to run the tableau file provided.
